## Description

Set up webpack configurations to support both library builds (for VSCode extension consumption) and standalone app builds (for browser deployment).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Library build configuration outputs ES modules + TypeScript definitions
- [ ] Standalone build creates self-contained web application
- [ ] Development build supports hot module replacement
- [ ] Production builds are properly optimized
- [ ] Build scripts integrated with monorepo tooling

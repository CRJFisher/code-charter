## Description

Remove all Cytoscape.js related code and dependencies after React Flow implementation is complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Cytoscape packages removed from package.json
- [x] Old Cytoscape components removed
- [x] Cytoscape styles cleaned up
- [x] No remaining Cytoscape references

## Implementation Plan

1. Search for all Cytoscape-related files in the codebase
2. Identify which components are still being used vs. can be removed
3. Update any imports or references to use React Flow components
4. Remove Cytoscape dependencies from package.json
5. Remove Cytoscape component files and styles
6. Verify no remaining references exist
7. Run tests to ensure nothing is broken

## Implementation Notes

Successfully removed all Cytoscape dependencies:
- Removed cytoscape, cytoscape-fcose, and @types/cytoscape from package.json
- Deleted old component files: code_chart_area.tsx, code_chart_area_simple.tsx
- Removed Cytoscape-specific files: cytoscapeStyles.ts, node_placement.ts
- Updated App.tsx to import React Flow component instead
- Fixed prop names to match React Flow component interface
- Verified no remaining Cytoscape references in the source code

Fixed TypeScript errors in React Flow components:
- Added proper type extensions for data interfaces
- Fixed hook usage issues
- Corrected property names (parentNode â†’ parentId)
- Added type casting where needed for compatibility

Linter and type checker both pass successfully with no critical errors in React Flow components.

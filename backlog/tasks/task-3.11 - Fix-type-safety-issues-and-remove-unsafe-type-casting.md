## Description

Remove unsafe type assertions and improve TypeScript type safety in React Flow implementation to prevent runtime errors and improve code maintainability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All 'as any' and unsafe type assertions removed
- [x] TypeScript compilation passes without type errors
- [x] Type-safe interfaces defined for all data structures
- [x] No runtime type-related errors in testing

## Implementation Plan

1. Identify all instances of 'as any' type casting in React Flow components
2. Create proper type definitions for React Flow state hooks
3. Define interfaces for node and edge data structures
4. Fix type issues in state persistence functions
5. Update zoom-aware node component type assertions
6. Ensure all component props are properly typed
7. Run TypeScript compiler to verify no type errors remain
8. Test all functionality to ensure no runtime errors

## Implementation Notes

Fixed all type safety issues in React Flow components:

- Added proper TypeScript types by importing ReactFlowInstance from @xyflow/react
- Created react_flow_types.ts with CodeChartNode and CodeChartEdge type definitions
- Updated all components to use typed hooks (useNodesState<CodeChartNode>, etc.)
- Fixed type assertions in zoom_aware_node.tsx by using NodeProps without generics
- Updated elk_layout.ts to use CodeChartNode instead of generic Node type
- Fixed navigation_utils.ts by properly typing the VS Code API
- Removed all 'as any' type assertions from non-test files
- All TypeScript compilation now passes without errors for React Flow components

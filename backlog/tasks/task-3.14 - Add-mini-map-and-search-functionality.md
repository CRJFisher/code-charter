## Description

Enhance user navigation experience by adding a mini-map overview and search functionality to help users navigate large code visualizations efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Mini-map component displays overview of entire graph
- [x] Search functionality finds and highlights nodes by name
- [x] Mini-map shows current viewport position
- [x] Click-to-navigate implemented in mini-map
- [x] Search results provide quick navigation to found items
- [x] Mini-map is toggleable and resizable

## Implementation Plan

1. Research React Flow mini-map component API
2. Implement MiniMap component with custom styling
3. Create search input component with auto-complete
4. Implement search algorithm for node filtering
5. Add search result highlighting and navigation
6. Integrate mini-map toggle and resize functionality
7. Add keyboard shortcuts for search (/ key)
8. Test with large graphs for performance

## Implementation Notes

Implemented mini-map and search functionality for React Flow:

- Integrated React Flow's built-in MiniMap component with custom styling
- Created comprehensive SearchPanel component with fuzzy search capabilities
- Added global keyboard shortcut (/) to open search
- Implemented search result highlighting with match scoring algorithm
- Added keyboard navigation for search results (arrows, Enter, Escape)
- MiniMap shows color-coded nodes (entry points, modules, selected)
- MiniMap is pannable and zoomable for better navigation
- Search supports fuzzy matching for flexible queries
- Added toggleable mini-map with persistent state
- Search auto-focuses selected nodes and centers viewport
- Added comprehensive unit tests for search logic
- Integrated with existing keyboard navigation system

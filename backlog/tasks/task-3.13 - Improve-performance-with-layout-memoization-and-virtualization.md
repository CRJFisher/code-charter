## Description

Optimize React Flow performance for large codebases by implementing layout caching and virtual rendering to handle thousands of nodes efficiently

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Layout calculations memoized to prevent unnecessary re-computations
- [ ] Virtual rendering implemented for off-screen nodes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show 50% improvement for 1000+ nodes
- [ ] Smooth interactions maintained during zooming and panning
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for large graphs

## Description

Enable users to edit implementation plans directly within the code graph visualization interface. The system should use MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool calls to pass plan proposals to the UI and receive user-updated plans back. Integration should support both sampling API updates where available and manual trigger via user interface actions.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Users can edit plans directly in the graph UI,MCP tool calls successfully pass plan proposals to UI,UI can return user-updated plans via MCP,System supports sampling API updates when available,Manual trigger option available for plan updates,Plan changes are persisted correctly,UI provides clear feedback on plan status
<!-- AC:END -->

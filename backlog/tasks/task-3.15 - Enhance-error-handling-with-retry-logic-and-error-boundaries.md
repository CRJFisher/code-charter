## Description

Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle layout failures, data processing errors, and provide user-friendly error recovery options

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Error boundaries catch and display user-friendly error messages
- [x] Retry logic implemented for transient layout failures
- [x] Graceful degradation when ELK.js layout fails
- [x] Loading states and error states clearly communicated to users
- [x] Error logging implemented for debugging purposes

## Implementation Plan

1. Create React error boundary component for React Flow
2. Implement retry logic for ELK layout failures
3. Add fallback layout algorithm when ELK fails
4. Create error notification component with retry button
5. Implement error logging service
6. Add timeout handling for long-running operations
7. Create graceful degradation for missing data
8. Add comprehensive error recovery tests

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive error handling system for React Flow with the following components:

### Error Boundary Component (`error_boundary.tsx`)
- Created `ErrorBoundary` React component that catches errors in child components
- Displays user-friendly fallback UI with error details and retry options
- Limits retry attempts with configurable `maxRetries` prop
- Includes expandable technical details section for debugging

### Error Handling Utilities (`error_handling.ts`)
- Implemented `withRetry` function for automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Added `ErrorRecovery` class with fallback strategies
- Created `ErrorLogger` class for centralized error tracking and reporting
- Implemented `ErrorNotificationManager` for managing user notifications
- Added custom error types: `LayoutError`, `DataProcessingError`, `TimeoutError`

### Error Notifications UI (`error_notifications.tsx`)
- Created `ErrorNotifications` component to display dismissible error messages
- Supports different severity levels (info, warning, error) with appropriate styling
- Includes action buttons for retry and other recovery options
- Automatically dismisses info notifications after 5 seconds

### Layout Error Handling (`elk_layout.ts`)
- Integrated retry logic into ELK layout calculation
- Implemented fallback grid layout algorithm when ELK fails
- Added caching to prevent repeated failures
- Enhanced with performance monitoring and error logging

### Integration into Main Component
- Wrapped React Flow component with ErrorBoundary
- Added error notifications to the UI
- Integrated error recovery into data fetching
- Added retry options in error notifications

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive tests for all error handling components
- Tests cover retry logic, error boundaries, notifications, and logging
- Some error boundary tests have limitations due to React test environment

The implementation provides robust error handling with graceful degradation, user-friendly error messages, and automatic recovery mechanisms. The system logs errors for debugging while keeping the user informed with actionable notifications.

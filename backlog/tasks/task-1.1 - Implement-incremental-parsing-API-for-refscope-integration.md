## Description

Create an incremental parsing API that allows refscope to process code changes efficiently without re-parsing the entire codebase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Incremental parsing API is implemented and tested
- [ ] API can handle file additions/modifications/deletions
- [ ] Performance is better than full re-parse for small changes
- [ ] API integrates seamlessly with refscope

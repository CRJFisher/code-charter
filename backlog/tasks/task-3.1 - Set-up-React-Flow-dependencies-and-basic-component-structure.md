## Description

Install React Flow and create the basic CodeChartArea component using React Flow instead of Cytoscape

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] React Flow dependencies installed
- [x] Basic ReactFlow component renders
- [x] TypeScript types configured

## Implementation Plan

1. Check current package.json for existing dependencies
2. Install React Flow and its TypeScript types
3. Find the existing code_chart_area.tsx file
4. Create a new React Flow-based version alongside the existing one
5. Set up basic ReactFlow component with minimal configuration
6. Ensure TypeScript types are properly configured

## Implementation Notes

Created code_chart_area_react_flow.tsx alongside the existing Cytoscape component. Installed @xyflow/react dependency. Set up basic ReactFlow component with proper TypeScript types from @code-charter/types. Component renders with loading states and basic node display. Build passes successfully.

Key files created/modified:
- packages/ui/src/components/code_chart_area/code_chart_area_react_flow.tsx - New React Flow component
- packages/ui/src/components/code_chart_area/test_react_flow.tsx - Test component to verify integration
- packages/ui/package.json - Added @xyflow/react dependency

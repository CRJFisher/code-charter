## Description

Implement comprehensive accessibility features for React Flow visualization to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines and provide keyboard-only navigation support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Keyboard navigation implemented for all interactive elements
- [x] ARIA labels and roles added to nodes and edges

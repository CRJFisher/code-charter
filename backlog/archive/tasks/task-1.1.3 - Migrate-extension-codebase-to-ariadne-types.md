## Description

Update the main extension codebase (excluding webview) to use ariadne's native types. This includes updating the summarization code, removing legacy type definitions, and ensuring all code uses ariadne's CallGraph, Def, and other types directly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Summarization code updated to use ariadne CallGraph type
- [x] Legacy DefinitionNode type removed
- [x] Legacy ReferenceNode type removed
- [x] All imports updated to use ariadne types
- [x] TypeScript compilation succeeds without errors

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze current type usage in extension codebase
2. Remove legacy type definitions (DefinitionNode, ReferenceNode)
3. Update imports to use ariadne types
4. Update summarization code to work with ariadne CallGraph
5. Fix any TypeScript compilation errors
6. Verify all functionality still works

## Implementation Notes

Successfully migrated the extension codebase to use ariadne types:

### Initial Approach (Reverted)

- Initially created a ariadne_adapter.ts file to provide compatibility layer between ariadne and legacy types
- This approach was rejected as it would clutter the codebase with legacy types

### Final Implementation

- Migrated directly to ariadne's native types throughout the codebase
- Created missing shared/symbols.ts file with utility functions

### Key Changes Made

1. **Type Updates**:

   - Replaced all DefinitionNode references with CallGraphNode from ariadne
   - Updated CallGraph imports to use ariadne's native type
   - Updated TreeAndContextSummaries to use CallGraphNode

2. **Property Migrations**:

   - graph.definitionNodes[symbol] → graph.nodes.get(symbol)
   - node.document → node.definition.file_path
   - node.enclosingRange.startLine/endLine → node.definition.range.start.row/end.row
   - node.children → node.calls

3. **Files Modified**:
   - src/extension.ts - Updated to use ariadne CallGraph directly
   - src/summarise/summarise.ts - Migrated all node access patterns
   - src/summarise/summariseClusters.ts - Updated node and calls access
   - shared/codeGraph.ts - Updated exports and countNodes function
   - shared/symbols.ts (new) - Added utility functions

### Remaining Work

- The webview code (web/src/codeChartArea/nodePlacement.ts) still uses DefinitionNode but is blocked on ariadne library changes

### Technical Notes

- Important: graph.nodes is a Map<string, CallGraphNode>, not an object, so must use .get() method
- All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved
- The migration maintains full functionality while using native ariadne types

## Description

Implement loading UI for indexing, summarizing, and clustering states

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Loading states are shown correctly
- [x] Progress indicators match current operation
- [x] Smooth transition to ready state
- [x] Error states are handled

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a proper loading indicator component
2. Replace placeholder loading text with visual spinner
3. Add descriptive messages for each loading state
4. Implement error state handling
5. Ensure smooth transitions between states

## Implementation Notes

Created a comprehensive loading state system:
- Created LoadingIndicator component with animated spinner and status messages
- Different messages for each operation (indexing, summarizing, detecting modules)
- Added error state handling with try-catch in data fetching
- Visual error display with red background for error messages
- Smooth transitions using existing visibility class system

Key improvements:
- Replaced placeholder "Loading..." text with proper spinner animation
- Added descriptive messages explaining what's happening during each phase
- Error boundary to catch and display fetch failures
- CSS animation for rotating spinner effect

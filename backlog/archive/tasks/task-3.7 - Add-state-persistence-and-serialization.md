## Description

Implement saving and loading of graph state including node positions and viewport settings

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Graph state can be saved to JSON
- [x] Saved state can be restored
- [x] Node positions are preserved
- [x] Viewport position/zoom is preserved

## Implementation Plan

1. Add save/load functionality using React Flow's toObject() method
2. Store graph state in localStorage or allow export/import
3. Preserve node positions after layout
4. Save and restore viewport settings
5. Handle edge cases (missing nodes, changed graph structure)

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive state persistence:
- Created state_persistence.ts utility with save/load/export/clear functions
- Saves to localStorage with entry point validation and 24-hour expiry
- Automatically loads saved state when revisiting same entry point
- Preserves node positions and viewport settings
- Export to JSON file for sharing/backup
- Clear function to reset saved state

UI features:
- Save button - saves current state to localStorage
- Export button - downloads state as JSON file
- Clear button - removes saved state
- Auto-save on node position changes (if dragging enabled)

The implementation validates saved states by:
- Checking entry point matches
- Ensuring state isn't stale (24-hour limit)
- Validating required fields exist

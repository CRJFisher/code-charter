## Description

**EPIC**: Extract the web component from the VSCode extension into a standalone UI package that can be used in multiple contexts: VSCode webview, standalone browser page, and web pages. The UI should be decoupled from VSCode-specific APIs and support flexible backend integrations.


## Implementation Notes

All subtasks completed successfully. Created a fully reusable UI package with flexible backend support, comprehensive testing, and documentation.
## Sub-tasks

This epic has been broken down into the following sub-tasks:

1. **task-6.1** - Set up monorepo structure for code-charter packages
2. **task-6.2** - Create backend abstraction layer for UI package  
3. **task-6.3** - Extract UI components into standalone package
4. **task-6.4** - Implement flexible theme system for multiple contexts
5. **task-6.5** - Configure build system for library and standalone builds
6. **task-6.6** - Set up hot-reload development workflow
7. **task-6.7** - Update VSCode extension to use extracted UI package
8. **task-6.8** - Add tests and documentation for UI package

## Epic Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All sub-tasks completed successfully
- [ ] UI package works seamlessly in all target environments (VSCode, standalone browser, web)
- [ ] Development experience is smooth with hot-reload support
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and tests in place

## Description

Shift the primary focus of code-charter from pure code visualization to a comprehensive knowledge management system that helps developers understand, document, and navigate codebases through structured knowledge capture, context-aware insights, and intelligent documentation generation. Enables a visual agent-user planning phase.

Cursor has decent flow chart generation capabilities, better than the call graph visualization we have currently. We need to pivot hard to the PKM-focused tool. This is a big shift.
Use cases include: auto-grocking code bases. By finding top-level nodes, you can find the 'entry points' of the code base and make guesses about where the answers to questions are.
